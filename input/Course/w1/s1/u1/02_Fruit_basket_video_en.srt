Mobius uses indentation for block
delimitation and it's done automatically
when a line is added to the procedure.

00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,160
For control structures like conditions and loops which can be nested in one another,
similar to how you add a statement to a specific line,
ensure the line is selected and click on the
interested statement to add it in.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,620
This video will also discuss the logic of
basic nested control statements:
nesting conditions within conditions and conditions within loops.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,000
Loop nesting
will be discussed next week.

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,020
Conditions can be nested within another condition block.

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,920
Its execution follows logic tree
and can be used when we are expecting
multiple states for the inputs and
returning a different output for each
condition.

8
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,860
For example, suppose we have a
basket of red apples, green apples,
oranges and lemons.

9
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,980
We want to sort them separately into individual baskets.

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,620
We may start off the condition check by
identifying whether the food is an apple.

11
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,640
If it is, we check for its color.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,420
If it is red, we put it in the first basket. If
green, in the second basket.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,180
Otherwise, if the fruit is an orange, place in the third basket.

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,560
At this point, if a fruit fails the check,
place it in the fourth basket. That's
for the lemons.

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,460
The block we had ended with earlier only checks for single fruit,
but what we want is to check an entire basket!

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,500
Essentially, this sorting block should be
run on every fruit in the basket.

17
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,500
To do this, we will loop through the basket at
one fruit at a time and run the check.

18
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,460
You will just be placing the condition block we have created earlier into a loop to do so.
