# Head 1

This is a test. Here we insert some images. When you click on the image, the full size version will open in another broswer tab. This allows diagrams with text to be viewed at a larger size.

![This is the alt text and also the image caption. The image will be centred. The caption will be shown below the image. If the caption is really long, it will wrap.](img2.jpg "A test image.")

## Head2 

This is a sub section.

![This is the alt text for the second image, called img1.jpg.](img1.jpg "A test image.")

![This is the alt text for the third image, called img3.jpg.](img3.jpg "Another test image.")
