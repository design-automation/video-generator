# Video Generator

A workflow to generate videos using Amazon Polly and Translate. This script serves to complement [edx-generator](https://github.com/design-automation/edx-generator) by processing videos stored in the input folder of an unit.

The aim is:
* to shorten a video creation timeframe by employing modern text-to-speech services by [AWS Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/)
* facilitate creation of educational videos from common instructional formats like powerpoint slides
* increase reach of videos by employing automated translation services
